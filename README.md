# Project Introduction (English)  |  [프로젝트 소개 (한글)](./README_ko.md)
* This project is an open-source project called XRCLOUD, which was developed by forking the [Hubs](https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation) project from [BELIVVR](https://belivvr.com). The goal was to develop additional features and provide resources of Hubs Rooms and Scenes as a membership-based cloud service.
* As of February 2025, BELIVVR has decided not to continue further development due to business challenges and has released it as open source.
* This is a detailed documentation service for partners who have been provided with development services, and it aims to contribute to the web metaverse open-source ecosystem, albeit in a small way.
* Please note that we did not have the capacity to send separate PRs to HubsFoundation, and the XRCLOUD service has secured servers that can be operated until September 2025, but there are no confirmed plans for the service thereafter. Technical support will be provided to partners who have been promised service until December 2025.
* For further inquiries, please contact the former CEO of BELIVVR, Byungseok Yang (fstory97@gmail.com).

# Installation and Operation
* Please refer to the [Installation and Operation Guide](./docs/installation_guide_ko.md).

# License
* Subprojects including hubs follow the licenses of their original projects.
* XRCLOUD follows the MIT license.

# Frameworks Used in XRCLOUD
* XRCLOUD-BACKEND: Nest.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, REDIS
* XRCLOUD-FRONTEND: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Docker

# Key Features and Characteristics
* XRCLOUD is a fork project of hubs and provides the basic features of hubs. It does not use the admin project of hubs, allowing various users to use one admin account of hubs through XRCLOUD, managing the resources of hubs through XRCLOUD.

## Differential Management by Membership Level (xrcloud)
* It is possible to set different levels for 3rd party developers and provide differentiated services through subscription management.

<img src="./docs/images/price_plan.png" alt="XRCLOUD service tier system">

* The XRCLOUD project aimed to expand the features of hubs to provide differentiated features and a membership-based cloud service.
* It is possible to limit the number of entries in a room and the number of scenes and rooms that can be created.
* A separate management tool was not developed, and upon registration, users are set to the default Tier, and upgrades to additional Tiers must be done in the database.
* Storage limitations and payment-related features are not implemented.

## Dashboard Service for Developers (xrcloud)
* Provides a dashboard service for managing members, projects, scene management corresponding to the web editor of the metaverse space, and room management corresponding to the metaverse space instance for 3rd party developers.

## OpenAPI Service for Developers (xrcloud)
* Provides APIs for managing projects, scenes, and rooms for 3rd party developers. For API details, please refer to the [XRCLOUD API Documentation](https://github.com/belivvr/xrcloud/xrcloud-backend/docs/api_ko.html).
* Provides APIs related to 3rd party members, allowing the creation of a creative platform through separate user management on the 3rd party developer's platform.
* It is possible to give differentiated permissions by dividing host and guest users.
* It is possible to generate expiring private URLs and continuously public URLs.

## Room Logging and Event Hooks (xrcloud)
* Added room logging and event hook features to XRCLOUD's custom hubs (hubs-all-in-one).
  * Room Logging: Logs events such as room entry, exit, and movement.
  * Event Hooks: Hooks events such as room entry, exit, and movement to deliver them externally.
  * It is possible to set a hook URL per project.

## Full-body Avatar (hubs)
* Supports [BELIVVR's open-source full-body avatar editor](https://github.com/belivvr/xrcloud-avatar-editor).
  * This avatar project is not designed considering Bit-ecs, so it does not support all features of Hubs.

## Jump (hubs)
* Pressing the J key in desktop mode makes the avatar jump.
  * Note: The full-body avatar resets the y-value to the ground when jumping, so it cannot jump.

## Third-person Free View Feature (hubs)
* Supports third-person view in desktop mode, with the camera positioned behind the avatar and adjustable camera position. When moving, the camera rotates behind the avatar's head to match the avatar's perspective.
  * There is a somewhat unnatural aspect due to the roll operation in the third-person free view. This part was not improved due to time constraints.

## Avatar Change Feature Set by URL on Entry (hubs)
* It is possible to change the avatar through URL query parameters.

## Fast Entry (hubs)
* Allows immediate entry by skipping the device and avatar setting modal window.

## Inline Frame/View Component (Spoke/hubs)
* A component similar to the link component but with enhanced features.
* **iframe-based content view**: A custom Spoke component by BELIVVR that can display content in the 3D main view of Hubs, chat sidebar, its own window, or a new window.
  * XRCLOUD's privateURL can pre-deliver data when generating the URL, allowing different content to be displayed for each user.

* **Button Text Customization**: Unlike the link component, users can modify the button text.

* **Avatar Change Feature**: It is possible to include avatar settings in the target URL and change them upon click.
  * When used with the mirror component of Spoke, it is possible to implement features such as an avatar shop.

* **Proximity Trigger**: Automatically activates within a specified distance.
  * When used with the avatar change feature, it is possible to enforce the use of a specific avatar in a specific room.
  
   <img src="./docs/images/spoke_inline_view_trigger_distance.png" alt="Proximity trigger">

* **Room Transition Without Refresh**: Supports room transitions without refresh, similar to the link component.
  * When used with the proximity trigger, it is possible to implement a natural portal transition feature that moves to another room at a specific location.
